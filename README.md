# topics-in-cis-project
This is the repository containing the final project and video presentation for the course CPTR328:Topics in Information Science. The project was built using Vue.js to create a Tuckshop App for the CHIPS department. 

Due to the video being too large for Git, I uploaded it to my google drive in the link for viewing.
